				<h1>Entry and exit</h1>
				<h2>Passport validity</h2>
				<p>If you travel to Syria against FCO advice, you’ll need a valid passport for at least 3 months after entry.
				Make sure you have a valid exit stamp on your travel documents if you need one, and take out <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fforeign-travel-insurance&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEL1B1EqWvfRdrnY4JPgS8ctyfydA">travel and medical insurance</a>.</p>
				<h2>Visas</h2>
				<p>You will need a visa.</p>
				<p>To stay more than 15 days, you must extend your visa at the immigration office or you could face problems when leaving the country.</p>
				<p>Under a new law, if you enter Syria illegally, you’ll be sent to prison for 5 to 10 years. You could also be fined between 5 to 10 million Syrian pounds. </p>
				<h2>Yellow fever</h2>
				<p>You must have the yellow fever vaccination if you’ve arrived from or took connecting flights through <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Fith%2Fchapters%2Fith2012en_annexes.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGgYISWGJ5BJAGLRpQFBVZVcfhoiA">countries with risk</a> of yellow fever transmission.</p>
				<h2>Previous travel to Israel</h2>
				<p>If you have an Israeli stamp in your passport, you’ll probably be refused entry to Syria.</p>

				<!-- <h2>Detailed summary</h2> -->
				<!-- <p id="no-travel">Travel not advised info</p>
				<p id="essential-travel-only">Essential travel only advised info</p>
				<p id="travel-as-normal">Travel as normal info</p> -->
				<h2>Civil unrest and political tension</h2>
				<p>There are full-scale military operations taking place in Syria.</p>
				<p>Widespread fighting continues throughout the country, including Damascus and its suburbs.</p>
				<p>In Aleppo and elsewhere, the regime has attacked civilians by air since mid-December. They have used ‘barrel bombs’ - huge containers packed with explosives and shards of metal, and dropped by helicopter. The situation remains very dangerous.</p>
				<p>There are reports of chemical weapons attacks. No group has claimed responsibility as yet.</p>
				<p>According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, there has been a large increase in the mass execution and illegal killing of civilians and detainees in northern Syria in the past few weeks.</p>
				<h2>Terrorism</h2>
				<p>There is a high threat from terrorism. </p>
				<p>Attacks across Syria have left large numbers of people dead or injured. Methods include:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>shootings</li>
				<li>aerial bombings</li>
				<li>suicide bombs</li>
				<li>vehicle bombs</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Terrorists have attacked:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>government property</li>
				<li>airports and transport</li>
				<li>border crossings</li>
				<li>public squares and tourist attractions</li>
				<li>hospitals</li>
				<li>places of worship</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Kidnapping</h2>
				<p>There’s a very high risk of kidnapping throughout Syria and some hostages have been killed.</p>
				<p>Kidnappers have taken British nationals and other westerners. Reports of kidnappings of Non-Governmental Organisation workers have increased in the last few months.</p>
				<p>Terrorists may see journalists and humanitarian aid workers as legitimate targets.</p>
				<h2>Air travel</h2>
				<p>Commercial flights have been reduced or suspended due to the conflict.</p>
				<h2>Road travel</h2>
				<p>Driving standards and traffic systems are poor, and the accident rate is high. Avoid driving at night.</p>
				<p>The driver is always legally responsible for an accident involving a pedestrian.   </p>
				<p>Roads have been blocked without warning and some have been temporarily closed, including:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Tartous-Latakia</li>
				<li>Tartous-Homs</li>
				<li>Latakia-Aleppo</li>
				<li>Homs-Hama</li>
				<li>Homs-Damascus</li>
				<li>Damascus-Jordan</li>
				</ul>
				<p>There are security force checkpoints on major roads.</p>
				<h2>Border crossings</h2>
				<p>Check routes before you travel. You might not be able to reach certain land borders, due to fighting and road closures.</p>
				<p>Opposition groups control some crossings. Others crossings are closed or vulnerable to attack.</p>
				<p>Crossing points to Jordan are closed from time to time.</p>
				<p>Don’t enter Iraq from Syria. There are restrictions on both sides.</p>
				<p>Borders to Lebanon are open, including the Masnaa crossing point on the Damascus-Beirut road.</p>
				<h2>Journalists</h2>
				<p>All foreign journalists need special permission from the authorities to enter Syria.</p>
				<p>Journalists and other foreigners in areas are vulnerable to mistreatment by armed groups.</p>
				<p>Syrian security forces and other armed groups have held journalists during the crisis. They have also confiscated phones, cameras and video cameras. Several foreign journalists have been killed.</p>
				<h2>Political and religious activity</h2>
				<p>There are restrictions on unlicensed political and religious activity in Syria.</p>
				<p>The Syrian authorities have detained and deported several British nationals for unauthorised activity.</p>
				<p>Activity in opposition-held areas will also attract attention. If you are deported by the local authorities, you will not be able to return to Syria.</p>
				<p>Be particularly vigilant in public places and keep a low profile. Don’t film or take photographs of public gatherings, military activity or any other sensitive matter.</p>
				<h2>Crime</h2>
				<p>The conflict has led to a rise in crime in some areas, including violent robbery, carjacking and kidnapping.</p>
