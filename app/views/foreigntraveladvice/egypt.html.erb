				Or you can get a visa from an Egyptian Consulate before you go.</p>
				<p>If you’re visiting Sharm El Sheikh, Dahab, Nuweiba or Taba for less than 15 days, you’ll get a free entry permission stamp on arrival.
				But you must get a visa, if you want to stay longer than 15 days or travel out of these resorts. You can normally buy one at Sharm El Sheikh airport.</p>

				<h1>Entry and exit</h1>
		<h2>Passport validity</h2>
		<p>If you travel to Syria against FCO advice, you’ll need a valid passport for at least 3 months after entry.
		Make sure you have a valid exit stamp on your travel documents if you need one, and take out <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fforeign-travel-insurance&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEL1B1EqWvfRdrnY4JPgS8ctyfydA">travel and medical insurance</a>.</p>
		<h2>Visas</h2>
		<p>You will need a visa.</p>
		<p>To stay more than 15 days, you must extend your visa at the immigration office or you could face problems when leaving the country.</p>
		<p>Under a new law, if you enter Syria illegally, you’ll be sent to prison for 5 to 10 years. You could also be fined between 5 to 10 million Syrian pounds. </p>
		<h2>Yellow fever</h2>
		<p>You must have the yellow fever vaccination if you’ve arrived from or took connecting flights through <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Fith%2Fchapters%2Fith2012en_annexes.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGgYISWGJ5BJAGLRpQFBVZVcfhoiA">countries with risk</a> of yellow fever transmission.</p>
		<h2>Previous travel to Israel</h2>
		<p>If you have an Israeli stamp in your passport, you’ll probably be refused entry to Syria.</p>

				<h1>Safety and security</h1>
				<h2>Detailed summary</h2>
				<!-- <p id="no-travel">Travel not advised info</p>
				<p id="essential-travel-only">Essential travel only advised info</p>
				<p id="travel-as-normal">Travel as normal info</p> -->
				<h2>Protests</h2>
				<p>Many people have died in violent clashes since President Morsi was removed from office in July 2013. Protests often happen on Fridays but can also happen at any time with little notice.</p>
				<p>Police may use water cannon, tear gas, birdshot or live ammunition for crowd control. Don’t cross roadblocks put up by the security forces or protesters.</p>
				<p>Protestors have singled out westerners, including Britons. Most clashes have taken place in Cairo, Alexandria and Fayoum but are common across Egypt including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Assyut</li>
					<li>Suez</li>
					<li>Ismaliyya</li>
					<li>Mansoura</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Terrorism</h2>
				<p>There is a high threat from terrorism.</p>
				<p>Security is tight throughout the country, especially in resort areas but the risk of attack is high, even in public places used by tourists.</p>

				<h2>Crime</h2>
				<p>The crime rate remains generally low, but security is affected by the current political unrest.</p>
				<p>Report a crime to the police immediately. Failure to report crimes before you leave Egypt will make it impossible to seek a prosecution at a later date.</p>

				<h2>Sexual crime</h2>
				<p>There’s a serious risk of violence and sexual assault at demonstrations, with reports of around 100 rapes and sexual assaults since June 2013.</p>
				<p>Sexual assaults have taken place in hotels, in taxis and on microbuses.</p>

			<section class="part" id="local-laws">
				<h1>Local laws</h1>
				<h2>Alcohol and drugs</h2>
				<p>You can be arrested for drinking alcohol in the street or anywhere apart from a licensed restaurant or bar.
				You may face life imprisonment or the death penalty for using, possession or trafficking of illegal drugs. </p>
				<h2>ID</h2>
				<p>Carry photo ID with you at all times.</p>
				<h2>Photography</h2>
				<p>Taking photos of or near military installations is strictly prohibited, including the Suez Canal.  Don’t photograph officials without their consent.  British nationals have been arrested for photographing electricity stations and train stations. </p>
				<h2>Homosexuality</h2>
				<p>Although homosexuality is not illegal under Egyptian law, homosexual acts in public are illegal and gay people have been convicted for breaching laws on public decency.</p>
				<h2>Religion</h2>
				<p>Encouraging conversion to the Christian faith is against the law.</p>
